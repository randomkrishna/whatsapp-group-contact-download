This works well with WhatsApp group on [https://web.whatsapp.com/](https://web.whatsapp.com/). First Install extension (steps below), click on group name and wait until the group info loads, click/visit on multiple groups to download the multiple groups contacts in single CSV file, once done then click on installed extension (in toolbar) to download a CSV file.

1. Download the repo and unzip it.

2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.

- The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over **More Tools** then selecting **Extensions**.

3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.

4. Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the unzipped directory.
