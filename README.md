1. Download the repo and unzip it.
2.  Open the Extension Management page by navigating to  `chrome://extensions`.
    -   The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over  **More Tools**  then selecting  **Extensions**.
3.  Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to  **Developer mode**.
4.  Click the  **LOAD UNPACKED**  button and select the unzipped directory.
